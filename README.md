# DSL IoT Kit

This software kit includes C/C++ code for NodeMCU-based IoT devices for use with the Arduino IDE that can be used to create a range of wireless sensors and displays useful for immersive experience design, as well as Max/MSP example patches and Javascript code that runs within Max to manage custom sensor to audio/video display mapping.

See the README files within the `Devices` and `Max/MSP-StateMachine` directories for detailed information.
