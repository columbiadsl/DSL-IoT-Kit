# About

This software kit includes C/C++ code for NodeMCU-based IoT devices for use with the Arduino IDE that can be used to create a range of wireless sensors and displays useful for immersive experience design, as well as Max/MSP example patches and Javascript code that runs within Max to manage custom sensor to audio/video display mapping.

See the README files within the `Devices` and `Max/MSP-StateMachine` directories for detailed information. 

This kit was developed in collaboration with the Columbia University School of the Art's <a href="http://digitalstorytellinglab.com">Digital Storytelling Lab.</a> 


# Where There's Smoke

The sample code within the kit comes from a project entitled <i>Where There's Smoke.</i> A mix between an immersive theatre experience, a documentary and an escape room, <i>Where There's Smoke</i> had its'world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in the Spring of 2019.

<b>Project Description:</b> In 1983 our van burst into flames on a family vacation. Eleven months later our house would burn to the ground. As I explore my past I find mysterious connections to these blazes and come face to face with a closet full of skeletons.

<i>Where There’s Smoke</i> mixes a live documentary, immersive theatre and elements of an escape room to create an experience that explores memory and loss. Set within the aftermath of a blaze, participants race to determine the cause of a tragic fire by sifting through the charred remains. Inspired by true events in writer/director Lance Weiler’s life, Where There’s Smoke details the connections between two mysterious fires and his father’s battle with cancer.

<b>Stats:</b> This project mixes analog, digital and archival elements. For instance, at the core of the immersive theater piece are over 1,000 fire slides that my father shot from 1968 to 1988. The slides are also being integrated into a graphic novel that examines connections between the blazes that destroyed our family van and house.
